/*
There are two types of programming:
    procedural programming
    object oriented programming (OOP)

OOP:
    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming System (or Object-Oriented Programming).
    It’s a way of writing programs where you organize code around objects instead of just functions and logic.

Component           Purpose

Class               Blueprint
Object              Real-world entity
Encapsulation       Data protection
Inheritance         Code reuse
Polymorphism        Multiple forms
Abstraction         Hide details

PILLARS OF OOP:

    Encapsulation:
    The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class).
    It restricts direct access to some of the object components, which help prevent unintended interference and misuse
    of the data.

    Inheritance:
    A mechanism where a new class (sub class/ child class) can inherit properties and behaviour from an existing class
    (super class/ parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

    Polymorphism:
    The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
    It allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, even though they share the same name.

    Abstraction:
    The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object.
    It helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency.
